Natural semantics
(big-step) and structural operational semantics (small-step) each have
advantages and disadvantages for various purposes, so it can be useful to produce
both semantic forms for a language. Previous work has shown that
big-step semantics can be transformed to small-step semantics. This is
also the goal of our work, but our main contribution  is to show that this can be done
by specialisation of an interpreter that imposes a small-step execution
on big-step transition rules.  This is more
direct and transparent than previous transformation methods, and allows
variations, such as the size of the small steps, as minor modifications.
It also exploits standard features of partial evaluation to handle
low-level manipulation of the transitions.
